### 1. Experimental Design
- Use cross-validation to measure performance rather than the fixed test / trainsplit provided by the starter code. Randomly pick 100 training and 100 testingimages for each iteration and report average performance and standarddeviations.


- Add a validation set to your training process to tune learning parameters. Thisvalidation set could either be a subset of the training set or some of theotherwise unused test set.


- Experiment with many different vocabulary sizes and report performance. E.g.10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 1000, 10000.




### 2. Experimental Results Analysis





### 3. Bonus Report (If you have done any bonus problem, state them here)

- Accelerate the process of generating sift features


- Add cross validation and the accuracy of three combinations exceeds the average
